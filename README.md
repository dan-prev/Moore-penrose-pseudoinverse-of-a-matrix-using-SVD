**Project Title**: Computing Moore-Penrose Pseudoinverse via Singular Value Decomposition

**Objective**: Develop a computational tool to determine the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of a given matrix using the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method.

**Background**:
The Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse is a generalization of the matrix inverse for non-square matrices. For matrices that are not invertible or for non-square matrices, the pseudoinverse provides a means to approximate a matrix inverse in a least-squares sense. One of the most robust and commonly used methods to compute the pseudoinverse is through Singular Value Decomposition. In the realm of machine learning, the pseudoinverse plays a pivotal role, especially in linear regression models. 

**Applications**:
The Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse has a plethora of applications in various fields:
- **Machine Learning**: For solving the normal equations in linear regression.
- **Control Systems**: Designing feedback control systems.
- **Signal Processing**: De-noising and other preprocessing steps.
- **Numerical Analysis**: Solving systems of linear equations, especially overdetermined or underdetermined systems.

**Conclusion**:
The ability to compute the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse reliably using SVD forms the bedrock of various advanced applications across domains, includind machine learning.
